Esse playground é uma visão geral dos recursos da linguagem Kotlin. Vou apresentar a sintaxe para iniciantes e explicar o básico, e o que faz do Kotlin uma linguagem que merece sua atenção.

### Prerequisite

This guide assume that you have some basic knowledge on programming principles.

### Organisation

I'll describe the following features as clearly as possible:

- Basics
  - Variables
  - String templates
  - Control expressions
  - Loops
- Classes
  - Properties
  - Inheritance
  - Data Classes
  - Sealed Classes
  - Visibility
- Functions Basics
- Nullability
- Java interoperability
- Type Checks and Smart Casts
- Collections
- Ranges
- Operator overloading
- Functions Extended
  - High-Order functions
  - Lambdas
  - Inline functions

For all this parts you'll find some explanation, flat code and nice interactive examples, that will 
show how Kotlin is a friendly companion to play with. 

> This documentation  is born from the desire to share some knowledge about Kotlin and the 
benefit to use a nice platform as tech.io.

> If you really want to get further with Kotlin I suggest you to read the book Kotlin In Action.

> NB: This Playground is wildly inspired by the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang
.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html)
